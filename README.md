# UnityTestProject

My version of the [tutorial Unity project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j48LtUkZRjU&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL&index=1) created by [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/@Brackeys). I'm loosely following the tutorial but making my own changes where I feel it's appropriate or where I want to learn more about something and give it a try.

The project is a [Velocibox](https://www.shawnbeckgames.com/velocibox/)-style endless runner game with the main goal of being a good introduction to Unity and game development in general.

My changes:
* Controller support using Unity's "new" (it's 4+ years old at this point xD) input system
* Add a GameState system that dives the game and is responsible for spawning the player
